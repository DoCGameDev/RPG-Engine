SESSION 1 : 12/02/2014


-----
General Discussion:
- According to a previously made poll, we have decided to make a 2D isometric, self-generating (procedural) RPG.

- Nandor has previous experience with isometric game engines and will be contributing a lot to this one.

- The language used will be C++. Script elements will be written in Lua.

- For next session, we should try to identify the elements the game engine should implement so that we can commence coding and scripting. 
	In parallel, we should also decide on what genre this RPG should be (fantastic, futurist, medieval, etc) and what gameplay elements we want.
	Sound and art should not be necessary for the moment apart from basic tiles for testing.
