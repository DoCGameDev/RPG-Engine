SESSION 3 : 26/02/2014

-----
More was discussed on the combat type:
- Double blind system : al the time the player want to decide his action.
- Player's and enemy's actions are executed "simultaneously": each is given a (potentially unknown) speed and then implemented from fastest to slowest.
- With this system, the player cannot move and attack in the same turn (except maybe charge).

Ideally, the player will be able to have modifiable robots/aliens that will be present on the battlefield (whether they act independently or take orders is still up to discussion)


-----
Skill bars idea confirmed. Base stats are still to be discussed.
