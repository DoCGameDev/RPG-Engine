General Discussion:
- THEME: Space / High-tech setting.
- Both high-tech weapons and psychic powers
- Have multiple skill bars, so the character can develop in all of them as he chooses.

Combat Type:
 ø The enemies are visible on the world map.
 ø When combat is engaged, a small area of the map (10x10 or circle) becomes an "arena" in which the combat takes place.
 ø During combat, the games pauses on the player's turn but the enemy acts almost immediately after, giving a small effect of real-time even though it actually is turn-based.
 ø Actual possible actions during combat are to be decided.
