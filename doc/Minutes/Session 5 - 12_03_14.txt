SESSION 5 : 12/03/14

-----
More brainstorming:

---Combat :
--Basic combat to be implemented first:
 - Keep the double-blind.
 - Combat round : input -> resolve (action by action) -> animate.
 - In combat have 4 basic actions : move, charge, melee, defend (in increasing initiative).
 - Simple AI : move towards the players tries to hit - defend when low on health / move away.
 - Move : move value & 1 square / mvpt. Point & click system with transparent display of range).

--Ideas for future development:
 - "Bonus squares" invisible but still active until some skill is learned/mastered.
   - Physical manifestation when accidentally activated -> constatnt when skill obtained.

---Overworld :
--General
 - Central traveling hub.
 - Variate enemy difficulty based on different criteria:
   - Presence of civilisation.
   - Presence of massive monster.
   - Environmental hazards.
   - Special buildings / places.
 - Scale??????

---Generation:
--Planets:
 - Make planets belong to different categories (allow crossovers). Give each category specific fauna and flora and have the planet randomly select from different categories to create unique environments.

--General map:
 - Really vague regions that are generated themselves as the player enters them.
 - Potentially have 4-6 fixed species whose empires span the world according to a random balance.
